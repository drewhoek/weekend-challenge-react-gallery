## React Gallery

### Description

Duration: 3 days

This project is a React gallery. It is an application with just a GET and PUT request. The GET will retrieve the pictures and corresponding information from the server and display it on the DOM. The PUT request comes in the shape of a "like" system where you can like an individual picture by pressing the like button underneath each framed picture. The total number of likes is shown on the DOM.

The other functionality of this app is some conditional rendering done by clicking on the frame, image or description. Clicking here will toggle a piece of state that will determine if the image is displayed or if the description is. Each of the frames is displayed individually through the use of React components.
